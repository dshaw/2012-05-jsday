# Production Node.js Secrets

Here are my slides from my talk at the [2012 JSDay](http://2012.jsday.it/talk/production-node-js-secrets/). You can view the slides by dropping index.html in your browser or by running:

    $ node app.js

...and going to http://localhost:8000

If you want to check out the emoji REPL demo, you need to run Node.js >= 0.7.7, then:

    $ node app.js --repl

I'm bundling the `node_modules` folder because the current Express version won't let you install under Node.js 0.7.
